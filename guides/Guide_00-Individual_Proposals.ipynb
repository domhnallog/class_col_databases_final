    "That said, completion is not really the ultimate goal in the next two weeks. I will be happy with any level of progress and learning as we use these projects to integrate the skills we've gained thus far in the program. The final classes--Friday and Saturday (July 5 and 6)--will consist mainly of presentations by each class member. The projects do not necessarily have to be complete by July 6--the presentations need only be a discussion of your experience of this process: your approach, the challenges you faced, and discoveries you made. It will be an opportunity to get feedback from community, and assess the process doing data projects as you go forward in this program.\n",

    "From a learning standpoint--I encourage you to consider the guided projects, I think it will be useful to have multiple presentations on the same project. But if you do want investigate your own set of data, please follow the instructions below."
