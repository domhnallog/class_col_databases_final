Found complete data sets everything
They're very clear its built for ther purposes it basically powers their website and that's the goal of its structure.
so it was a little work to get data I can parse

they order careers by the first federal appointment and then the second etc. so you can't easily snapshot the situation today
tried a bunch of things and ran down rabbit holes
ultimately cheated and had to use Excel
felt dirty

super-useful data in here
they have organize judges by imaginary seat numbers on each panel but it inexplicable uses a different coding system than other parts of the site 
so i made key-tables to cross any judicial info I might find by court full name, short name, bluebook code and the coding system of the website
i also made a key-table to add a bit more presidential info which brought to my attention that the courts site is a stickler for presidential names e.g. "S" in Ulysses Grant & Harry Truman names.
they also have a judicial emergency category
